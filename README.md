Ticket intake refers to the process by which new support requests (or "tickets") are captured and added to the osTicket help desk system. It is the first step in the lifecycle of a support ticket and determines how, where, and by whom the ticket will be handled. Ticket intake in osTicket is a flexible and automated process that ensures all support requests. Whether submitted by portal, email, or staff, tickets are properly recorded, routed, and prioritized. It forms the foundation of efficient help desk operations.

In osTicket, assignment ensures tickets are directed to the right personnel, while communication tools (notes, replies, alerts) keep all Involved parties informed and engaged. Together, they form the backbone of a responsive and organized helpdesk operation.

<p>
“Working the Issue” in osTicket is the heart of the support process where agents actively investigate, communicate, and resolve user requests while adhering to service expectations. It’s where technical skill meets customer service.

In osTicket, Resolution marks the successful handling of a support request. It includes documenting the solution, notifying the user, updating ticket status, and triggering reporting. A clear and well-communicated resolution builds trust and helps maintain service excellence.

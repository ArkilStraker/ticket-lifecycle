Ticket intake refers to the process by which new support requests (or "tickets") are captured and added to the osTicket help desk system. It is the first step in the lifecycle of a support ticket and determines how, where, and by whom the ticket will be handled. Ticket intake in osTicket is a flexible and automated process that ensures all support requests. Whether submitted by portal, email, or staff, tickets are properly recorded, routed, and prioritized. It forms the foundation of efficient help desk operations.

In osTicket, assignment ensures tickets are directed to the right personnel, while communication tools (notes, replies, alerts) keep all Involved parties informed and engaged. Together, they form the backbone of a responsive and organized helpdesk operation.
